Debt Service
Overview
The Debt Service handles the management of user debts. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, and updating debts. It works in conjunction with the Auth Service to secure endpoints and ensures that only authorized users can manage their debts.

Key Features
Debt Management: Allows users to add, update, and view debts.
Authentication: Requires JWT tokens for all debt-related actions.
Feign Client: Integrates with other services using Feign for communication.
